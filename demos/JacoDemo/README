This folder provides a few simple demos to test and become acquainted with the
CLSquare interface for the Kinova Jaco robotic arm. At present, two demos are
included.


gamepad.cls
============
Controls the robot through an 8-axis gamepad. The demo is written for a
Thrustmaster PS3 controller, but can be adapted to other pads or joysticks
by changing the axis assignment in the [Controller] section.
Note that the default gamepad requires pressing both triggers and the square
button once at the beginning for proper operation.


pipe.cls
========
Controls the robot by sending target poses through the CLSquare pipe.
Predefined positions are center, left and right, which are set by
$ echo "controller_cmd <position>" > /tmp/pipe2cls
