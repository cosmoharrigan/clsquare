Installation advises for FrameView2d:

copy frameview-1.X.tar.gz to your favourite directory (e.g. /usr/local
or /home/myname/). 

gunzip it with 

   gunzip framview-1.X.tar.gz 

and untar it with 

    tar -xvf framview-1.X.tar 

go to the created directory framview-1.X

    cd framview-1.X 

run make 

    make 

depending on your local system you will have to change the lines 

    CXXINCLUDE      = -I/usr/X11R6/include
    CXXLIBS         = -lm -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lX11
            
in your Makefile to compile correctly.     

Now run 

    2dview -help  

to get some information about the possibilities of FrameView2d. To run
it with a SoccerServer just start FrameView2d after the
SoccerServer. If the SoccerServer is already running just put the key
'c' to "connect" to the server (don't put 'c' more than once, because
each pressing initializes a new connection stub in the  SoccerServer).

This section is optional:

Here a short description how to use other devices then the soccer
monitor is given (especially for the AsciiDevice).

run 
   make client2dview

to get a simple program which can control the AsciiDevice of
FrameView2d. 

You should get a new program

   client2dview

Now run 

   2dview -ascii

and then 

   client2dview -file field_robocup_middlesize.fvd

to see how you can build a new scene from a file. Consult the files

   ascii_processor.h ascii_processor.C ascii_dev.h ascii_dev.C

to get more knowledge how to use the AsciiDevice. Also consult the
main() function in the

   client2dview.C

file to learn more about other demos. Here just one further example

Run 
   2dview -ascii

and 
   client2dview -tree

to get the tree into movement.
